# OİS İSTÜN Security Code Helper

## For İSTÜN Students
Why are there so many security checks? Calm down, I'm saving you, my İSTÜN friends. See the usage below.

## How It Works?
When we want to log in to the OIS system a lot during the day, we have to enter the daily code each time. With Code Helper, you only need to do this once a day. Once you enter the code correctly, it will be automatically filled in for your next logins.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lightningcell/ois-istun-security-code-helper.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ois-istun-security-code-helper
   ```
3. Follow the specific setup instructions for your environment.

## Usage
1. Load the extension in your browser:
   - Open your browser's extensions page.
   - Enable "Developer mode".
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory.
2. Use the extension to quickly pass unnecessary security checks.


## Features
   **Active:** Enable or disable the extension. When disabled, none of the automation features will work.

   **Wait While Redirecting:** Shows a countdown before automatically submitting the security code or clicking confirm buttons.
   
   **Show Panel:** Displays the security code in a panel at the top of the screen instead of auto-submitting.
   
   **Custom Theme (Beta):** Applies custom styling to OIS pages for a better user experience.
